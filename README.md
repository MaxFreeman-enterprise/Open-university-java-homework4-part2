in this assignment we were asked to write a Boolean static function for searching integer number in a two-dimensional array that is also suppose to be rotationally sorted array, the function receives as parameters a two-dimensional array and a integer value. the function searching the requested number by the user, if the number is exists in the array and also the array is rotationally sorted as well, then the functions will return true else she will return false.

And we were also asked to analyze in this function the running time complexity of the program. and also to analyze the space complexity of the program. of course we was asked to do so in the minimum as possible in terms of space and time complexity.

The analysis of the running time and place complications are written in the comments above the code.
